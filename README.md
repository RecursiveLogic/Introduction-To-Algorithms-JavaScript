# Introduction-To-Algorithms-JavaScript

This is an ongoing project of mine to map all the algorithms in the book Introduction To Algorithms
3rd Edition, all in JavaScript. I'll try to make them as easy to read as possible. The book is 1300 
pages long, so it might take me a little while to finish it all, or to keep updating this repo on a 
quick basis, as this book really explains the nooks and crannies of each algorithm, taking up to 
about 20-40 pages to explain each one. In any case, I hope this helps out anyone just starting out 
in programming through JavaScript to learn computer science fundamentals!
